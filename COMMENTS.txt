- Main architecture decisions. -
--------------------------------
For this application I used a simple but robust architecture and and oriented exclusively to meet the application's purpose.

Using a subclass of FragmentActivity as the main Activity and  a ListView widget for list more than one result.
This to better enjoy the onItemClickListenner thus making a cleaner architecture.

The SearchAddressAsyncTask class is a AsyncTask which was established to carry out research and background processing and update the 
data in the interface.

A custom icon also gives a better appearance to the application.

No third party libraries was used.

If there was more time available to continue improving the application I seek to bring more pleasant items to the application interface 
in order to further enhance the experience with the user.

I did use the Android API Testing because I'm a novice programmer in Android and have no knowledge about the use of this tool.
